# Brain-cancer-prediction-app
## Overview
The Brain Cancer Prediction app is a machine learning-powered tool designed to assist medical professionals in detecting brain cancer. Using a set of measurements, the app predicts whether a cell mass is benign or malignant. It provides a visual representation of the input data using a radar chart and displays the predicted diagnosis and probability of being benign or malignant. The app can be used by manually inputting the measurements or by connecting it to a cytology lab to obtain the data directly from a machine. The connection to the laboratory machine is not a part of the app itself.
## Installation
To run the Cell Image Analyzer locally, you will need to have Python 3.6 or higher installed. Then, you can install the required packages by running:

pip install -r requirements.txt
This will install all the necessary dependencies, including Streamlit, OpenCV, and scikit-learn.
